## 🎯 Comparison Operators

### **What Are Comparison Operators?**

Comparison operators in C# are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is always a **boolean** (`true` or `false`). These operators are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program, especially in conditional statements like `if`, `while`, or `for`.

### **List of Comparison Operators**

|Operator|Description|Example (`x = 5`, `y = 6`)|
|---|---|---|
|`==`|Checks if two values are **equal**.|`x == y` → `false`|
|`!=`|Checks if two values are **not equal**.|`x != y` → `true`|
|`>`|Checks if the left value is **greater** than the right.|`x > y` → `false`|
|`<`|Checks if the left value is **less** than the right.|`x < y` → `true`|
|`>=`|Checks if the left value is **greater than or equal to** the right.|`x >= x` → `true`|
|`<=`|Checks if the left value is **less than or equal to** the right.|`x <= x` → `true`|

---

### **Examples**

Here are some examples of comparison operators in action:

```csharp
int x = 5;
int y = 6;

Console.WriteLine(x == y);  // 👈 Checks if x is equal to y → Prints: "False"
Console.WriteLine(x != y);  // 👈 Checks if x is not equal to y → Prints: "True"

Console.WriteLine(x > y);   // 👈 Checks if x is greater than y → Prints: "False"
Console.WriteLine(x < y);   // 👈 Checks if x is less than y → Prints: "True"

Console.WriteLine(x >= x);  // 👈 Checks if x is greater than or equal to x → Prints: "True"
Console.WriteLine(x <= x);  // 👈 Checks if x is less than or equal to x → Prints: "True"
```

---

### **Character Comparisons**

In C#, characters can also be compared using comparison operators. The comparison is based on the **Unicode values** of the characters.

**Example:**

```csharp
char a = 'A'; // Unicode value: 65
char b = 'B'; // Unicode value: 66

Console.WriteLine(a == b); // 👈 Prints: "False" (65 != 66)
Console.WriteLine(a < b);  // 👈 Prints: "True"  (65 < 66)
Console.WriteLine(a > b);  // 👈 Prints: "False" (65 > 66)
```

#### **Understanding Unicode Comparisons**

The Unicode standard assigns a numeric value to every character. Comparisons between characters are made using these values.  
For example:

- `'A'` has a Unicode value of 65.
- `'a'` has a Unicode value of 97.
- `'0'` has a Unicode value of 48.

This means that `'A' < 'a'` evaluates to `true` because `65 < 97`.

### **Practical Use Cases for Comparison Operators**

#### **1. Conditional Statements**

Comparison operators are commonly used in `if` statements to control the program's behavior based on conditions.

**Example:**

```csharp
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are eligible to vote."); // 👈 Prints: "You are eligible to vote."
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

---

#### **2. Loops**

They are essential for controlling loops by setting boundaries or conditions for iteration.

**Example with `while` loop:**

```csharp
int count = 0;

while (count < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(count); // 👈 Prints: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"
    count++;
}
```

---

#### **3. Sorting and Filtering Data**

Comparison operators are used in algorithms to sort and filter data.

**Example:**

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 3, 7, 2, 8, 5 };

foreach (var number in numbers)
{
    if (number > 5)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(number); // 👈 Prints: "7, 8"
    }
}
```

---

### **Advanced: Combining Comparisons with Logical Operators**

Comparison operators are often combined with **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to evaluate more complex conditions.

**Example:**

```csharp
int score = 85;

if (score >= 80 && score <= 100)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Excellent score!"); // 👈 Prints: "Excellent score!"
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Keep trying!");
}
```

---

### **Common Mistakes and Pitfalls**

1. **Confusing Assignment (`=`) with Comparison (`==`)**  
    One of the most common errors is using `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (comparison).
    
    ```csharp
    int x = 5;
    
    if (x = 10) // ❌ Incorrect: This assigns 10 to x instead of comparing.
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error!"); 
    }
    
    // Correct version:
    if (x == 10) // ✅ This checks if x is equal to 10.
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Correct!");
    }
    ```
    
2. **Ignoring Data Types in Comparisons**  
    Always ensure the operands are compatible. For instance, comparing a string to an integer will result in an error.
    
    ```csharp
    string str = "5";
    int num = 5;
    
    // Console.WriteLine(str == num); // ❌ Error: Cannot compare string and int directly.
    ```
    
3. **Character Comparisons May Not Behave as Expected**  
    When comparing characters, remember they are evaluated based on Unicode values, which might lead to unexpected results.
    
    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine('A' > 'a'); // 👈 Prints: "False" (65 < 97)
    ```

### **Conclusion**

- Comparison operators return `true` or `false` based on the comparison between two values.
- They are widely used in conditional logic, loops, and data filtering.
- Always be cautious about using `=` for assignment and `==` for comparison to avoid errors.
- Understanding Unicode is key when working with character comparisons.

By mastering comparison operators, you can create dynamic and responsive programs that make decisions based on data!
