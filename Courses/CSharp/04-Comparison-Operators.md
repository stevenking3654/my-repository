## ðŸŽ¯ Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and return a result based on whether the comparison is true or false (type `bool`).

Comparison operators include:
- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

```csharp
var x = 5;
var y = 6;

Console.WriteLine(x == y); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "False"
Console.WriteLine(x != y); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "True"

Console.WriteLine(x > y); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "False"
Console.WriteLine(x < y); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "True"

Console.WriteLine(x >= x); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "True"
Console.WriteLine(x <= x); // ðŸ‘ˆ Prints: "True"
```

Characters can be compared using the same comparison operators. The comparison is based on the Unicode values of the characters.
