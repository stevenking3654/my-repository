## ðŸŽ© Operators Precedence in C#

When writing complex expressions involving multiple operators, the **order of evaluation** can significantly affect the result. This order is determined by **operator precedence**, which specifies the rules that dictate the sequence in which operators are evaluated.

### **Understanding Precedence**

- Operators with **higher precedence** are evaluated **before** operators with lower precedence.
- If operators have the **same precedence**, their evaluation depends on their **associativity**:
    - **Left-to-right** associativity: Operators are evaluated from left to right.
    - **Right-to-left** associativity: Operators are evaluated from right to left.

### **Common Precedence Rules**

Arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators each have their own precedence, summarized below:

|**Operator**|**Description**|**Associativity**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|`()`|Parentheses|Left-to-right|`(true && false)`|
|`!`|Logical NOT|Right-to-left|`!true`|
|`* / %`|Multiplication, Division, Modulus|Left-to-right|`10 * 2 / 5`|
|`+ -`|Addition, Subtraction|Left-to-right|`5 + 3 - 2`|
|`< <= > >=`|Comparison Operators|Left-to-right|`10 > 5`|
|`== !=`|Equality Operators|Left-to-right|`5 == 5`|
|`&&`|Logical AND|Left-to-right|`true && false`|
|`||`|Logical OR|
|`=`|Assignment Operator|Right-to-left|`x = 10`|

### **Precedence in Action**

#### **1. Parentheses Take Highest Precedence**

Parentheses (`()`) have the highest precedence. They ensure that the enclosed expression is evaluated first, regardless of other operators.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine((10 + 5) * 2); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: 30
// Without parentheses: 10 + (5 * 2) => 20
```

---

#### **2. Arithmetic Operators**

Multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`) take precedence over addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(10 + 5 * 2); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: 20
// Evaluated as: 10 + (5 * 2)
```

To change the order, use parentheses:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine((10 + 5) * 2); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: 30
```

---

#### **3. Comparison vs. Logical Operators**

Comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) have **higher precedence** than logical operators (`&&`, `||`).

```csharp
var x = 8;
var y = 5;
var z = 10;

Console.WriteLine(x > y && x < z); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: true
// Evaluated as: (x > y) && (x < z) => true && true
```

---

#### **4. Logical Operators: AND (`&&`) vs. OR (`||`)**

Logical AND (`&&`) has **higher precedence** than Logical OR (`||`).

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(true || false && false); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: true
// Evaluated as: true || (false && false) => true || false => true
```

To change the precedence:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine((true || false) && false); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: false
```

---

#### **5. Associativity: Right-to-Left**

Operators like assignment (`=`) are evaluated from **right to left**. This means the rightmost expression is evaluated first.

```csharp
int a, b, c;
a = b = c = 5; // ðŸ‘ˆ Assigns 5 to c, then b, then a
Console.WriteLine(a); // Output: 5
```

---

### **Practical Examples**

#### **Example 1: Combining Arithmetic and Logical Operators**

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 3;

Console.WriteLine(x > y + 5 || x < y * 2); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: false
// Evaluated as: (x > (y + 5)) || (x < (y * 2))
// => (10 > 8) || (10 < 6)
// => true || false
// => true
```

---

#### **Example 2: Misunderstanding Precedence**

Misinterpreting precedence can lead to bugs:

```csharp
int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;

Console.WriteLine(a + b < c && c > b); // ðŸ‘ˆ Output: true
// Evaluated as: ((a + b) < c) && (c > b)
// => (15 < 15) && (15 > 10)
// => false && true
// => false
```

### **Tips for Managing Precedence**

1. **Use Parentheses for Clarity:**  
    Always use parentheses to make your intention explicit and improve code readability.
    
    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine((a + b) < c && (c > b)); // Clear and unambiguous
    ```
    
2. **Understand Associativity Rules:**  
    Familiarize yourself with left-to-right or right-to-left associativity for operators.
    
3. **Consult the Precedence Table:**  
    Keep the precedence table handy for quick reference when writing complex expressions.

### **Conclusion**

Operator precedence is a critical concept in programming that ensures expressions are evaluated as intended. By understanding precedence and associativity, you can write cleaner, bug-free code and manage complex expressions with confidence.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
- Parentheses always override precedence.
- Logical AND (`&&`) has higher precedence than Logical OR (`||`).
- Assignment operators (`=`) are evaluated from right to left.
