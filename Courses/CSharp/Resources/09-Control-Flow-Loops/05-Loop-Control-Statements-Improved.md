## üîß Mastering Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements are powerful tools that give you the ability to control the flow of loops in programming. They help you fine-tune how loops behave based on specific conditions. These include:

- **`break`**: Stops the loop entirely and exits.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
- **`return`**: Exits the loop _and_ the enclosing method (in specific scenarios).

### üè≠ **Factory Line Analogy**

Imagine you're managing a factory line. The conveyor belt (your loop) keeps moving items for quality checks. Here's how loop control statements come into play:

- **`break`**: Like hitting the emergency stop button when a critical error occurs.
- **`continue`**: Like skipping a defective item and moving to the next.
- **`return`**: Like shutting down the entire station and leaving the room.

### ‚úã **The `break` Statement**

The `break` statement stops the loop execution as soon as a specific condition is met.

#### üñä **Example: Find the First Number Divisible by `7`**

```csharp
for (int number = 100; number <= 200; number++)
{
    if (number % 7 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found the first number divisible by 7: {number}");
        break; // Exit the loop
    }
}
```

#### üìñ **Explanation**:

1. **Condition Check**:  
    The condition `number % 7 == 0` checks if the remainder is `0`, indicating divisibility by `7`.
    
2. **Action on Condition**:  
    When the condition is true, the number is printed, and the loop is terminated using `break`.
    
3. **Flow Control**:  
    No further iterations occur once the `break` statement executes.
    

#### üîç **Output**:

```
Found the first number divisible by 7: 105
```

### ‚è≠Ô∏è **The `continue` Statement**

The `continue` statement allows skipping the rest of the current iteration and proceeding to the next one.

#### üñä **Example: Print Only Odd Numbers**

```csharp
for (int number = 1; number <= 10; number++)
{
    if (number % 2 == 0)
    {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    Console.WriteLine(number); // Print odd numbers
}
```

#### üìñ **Explanation**:

1. **Condition Check**:  
    The condition `number % 2 == 0` checks if the number is even.
    
2. **Skipping Iterations**:  
    When the condition is true, `continue` skips the rest of the loop body for that iteration.
    
3. **Printing Odd Numbers**:  
    Only numbers that don't meet the condition are printed.
    

#### üîç **Output**:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### üîö **The `return` Statement**

The `return` statement halts both the loop and the enclosing method, exiting the program's flow entirely.

#### üñä **Example: Check if a Number is Prime**

```csharp
var number = 4;

if (number <= 1)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{number} is not a prime number.");
    return; // Exit the method early
}

for (int divisor = 2; divisor < number; divisor++)
{
    if (number % divisor == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{number} is not a prime number.");
        return; // Exit as soon as a divisor is found
    }
}

Console.WriteLine($"{number} is a prime number.");
```

#### üìñ **Explanation**:

1. **Immediate Validation**:  
    If `number <= 1`, the program exits early, identifying it as not a prime number.
    
2. **Loop for Divisors**:  
    The loop checks if the number is divisible by any smaller number.
    
3. **Action on Divisor Found**:  
    If a divisor is found, `return` exits the method, skipping all remaining checks.
    
4. **Prime Confirmation**:  
    If no divisor is found, the number is declared prime.
    

#### üîç **Output**:

|Input|Output|
|---|---|
|`4`|`4 is not a prime number.`|
|`5`|`5 is a prime number.`|

### üí° **Why Use Loop Control Statements?**

Loop control statements make your code:

- **Efficient**: Avoid unnecessary computations by exiting loops early.
- **Readable**: Clearly communicate the logic flow and intent.
- **Dynamic**: Adapt behavior based on runtime conditions.

By mastering `break`, `continue`, and `return`, you gain precise control over your program's execution. Practice these tools, and your code will be both smarter and more elegant! üöÄ
